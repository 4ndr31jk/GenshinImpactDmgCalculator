The algorithm here estimate how much damage your enemy will take.

How can i execute the code:
enter the terminal and use the comand "java Main" and add  8 arguments: base atk,atk%,flat atk WITHOUT THE BASE ATK,ability (talent skill%) , bonus like elemental bonus or phisycal bonus, character lv, monster level and monster resistance 

WARNING ARGUMENTS SHOULD BE ALL NUMBERS 

How the code works?
It uses a formula for etimating the output wich is:
FINAL DMG = Initial DMG * %DEF Multiplier * %RES

Initial dmg = atk * %ability *%bonus
atk = base atk 	 * (1+%atk) + flat atk
def multiplier = charlv +100 /monsterlv +200
res is a constant that every monster has to a specific element or phisycal

final dmg = (base atk *(1+%atk) + flat atk) * %ability * %bonus * (charlv + 100 / monsterlv + 200) + %RES
